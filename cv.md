# __Summary:__
I am self-organized and very motivated to become a good programmer. And once I saw JavaScript and fell in love with it. For the first time, something became interesting to me. I wanted to do JS professionally. I wanted to become a specialist in JS. Finally, I got a real motivated goal! I every day learn something new for me.
